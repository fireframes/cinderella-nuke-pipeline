# Cinderella 2025 — Nuke Pipeline Tools
This repository contains the Nuke pipeline tools and configurations for the **Cinderella** feature film production of **AA Studio**.
The goal of this pipeline is to streamline the compositing workflow, enforce consistency, 
and enable easier tool sharing between artists. The **Shot Manager panel** serves as the central hub for shot navigation, Nuke-scripts management, version control, and publishing workflows.
It includes custom and licensed gizmos, scripts, icons, and automation helpers tailored for the needs of this project.
